            <p id="aboutMeText"> I love games from the moment I first encountered them! I remember the first game I ever
                played was
                'Heretic.' After spending thousands of hours playing games, it seemed like the perfect idea to merge my
                passion with work. That's why I'm looking for a place where I can unleash my creativity and imagination!

                I started my first job in game development right after obtaining my engineering degree at the University
                of Silesia in Katowice. It involved porting games, but I believe the perfect job for me would be
                creating games. I think it's because one is aware of leaving something behind when working on game
                development.</p>
